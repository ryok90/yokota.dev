# Rodrigo Yokota's Landing Page - https://yokota.dev

This landing page was made possible with the incredible design work of [Guyllian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guyllian-kanashima-sasano-95b8b715a/), be sure to check out her amazing work.

## The Dream
I have a dream of becoming the most famous **Rodrigo Yokota** of *Google Search*. This landing page is the beginning of the achievement of this dream. It is unbelievably hard to do so seeing that the first place is held today by a great artist with a bunch of published and admired work. How can an introverted Software Engineer compete with that?

## The Tools
To develop this simple webpage I used [React](https://reactjs.org/) with [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/) for styling. To boilerplate it all I used [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). My domain was bought on [Google Domains](https://domains.google/) which made some things easier and faster. I left it all hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) which has some automated workflows for the build and deploy.

Simple reasons for those choices:
- **React**: a library that I am most familiar with
- **Next.js**: it really is blazing fast and already has the settings I needed
- **ChakraUI**: it is quite easy and fast to get started and has an amazing API for responsiveness
- **Vercel**: Easy and fast deploy solution for a Next.js app that has a lot of built-in tools to help SEO
- **Google Domains**: I already had other domains on it and the UI feels pretty simple and intuitive

Feel free to send suggestions or questions about this tiny little project.
