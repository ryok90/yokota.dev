# Rodrigo Yokota's Landing Page - https://yokota.dev

This landing page was made possible with the incredible design work of [Guyllian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guyllian-kanashima-sasano-95b8b715a/), be sure to check out her amazing work.

## The Dream
I have a dream of becoming the most famous **Rodrigo Yokota** of *Google Search*. This landing page is the beginning of the achievement of this dream. It is unbelievably hard to do so seeing that the first place is held today by a great artist with a bunch of published and admired work. How can an introverted Software Engineer compete with that?

## The Tools
To develop this simple webpage I used [React](https://reactjs.org/) with [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/) for styling. To boilerplate it all I used the blazing-fast [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). My domain was bought on [Google Domains](https://domains.google/) which made some things easier and faster. Hosting on the easy and friendly [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I also took advantage of the [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to deploy the page automatically.

Simple reasons for those choices:
- **React**: a library that I am most familiar with
- **ChakraUI**: it is quite easy and fast to get started and has an amazing API for responsiveness
- **Vite**: it really is blazing fast and already has the settings I needed
- **Google Domains**: I already had other domains on it and the UI feels pretty simple and intuitive
- **GitHub Pages**: I thought about using a CDN to host the static files but for now this was easier and shall suffice
- **GitHub Actions**: there is plenty of actions ready to build and deploy to the GitHub Pages

Feel free to send suggestions or questions about this tiny little project.
